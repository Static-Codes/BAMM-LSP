BAM Manager (BAMM) is a Dynamic Scripting Language (DSL) that compiles into Python 3.9+ code.

This DSL known as **BAMC** **(BAM Config)** simplifies Selenium by allowing you to write automation scripts in a more concise, readable, and English-like language.

Your **.BAMC** file is then passed to the compiler, which creates a Python file containing your desired workflow, effectively reducing the amount of boilerplate you need to manage.
